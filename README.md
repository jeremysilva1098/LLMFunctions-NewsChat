# LLMFunctions-NewsChat
Building a News ChatBot in an effort to experiment with LLM function calls.

NewsChat works by using OpenAI functions to generate function calls which are executed against the Google News API allowing the LLM to access real time news articles.

This enables both real time information as well as transparent citations of underlying sources.

Here is a video of the primary user interace.
